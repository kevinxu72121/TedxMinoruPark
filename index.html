          TEDxMinoru Park Youth is a new event licensed in May 2023, marking the
          first TEDx event in Richmond, BC in over two years. We are excited to

          annual event. Our team is committed to creating an unforgettable
          experience that inspires and empowers the youth of Richmond. With the
          support of TED, we are determined to foster a platform for ideas worth
          spreading and contribute to the intellectual growth of our local
